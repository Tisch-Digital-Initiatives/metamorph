*Metamorph* requires the following Python modules which must be installed, e.g. 'pip install pandas'
* pandas
* saxonche
* openpyxl

* python-magic-bin

*Metamorph* can be launched from the command line with 'python metamorph.py'. From MacOS or Linux, it should be possible to launch by clicking on metamorph.py as an application.
